# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard
🚀 Completed My First End-to-End Excel Dashboard Project! 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard, built entirely in Excel! This project helped me explore data visualization, pivot tables, slicers, and interactive reporting. 📊🚑🏥

Key Insights from the Dashboard:

✅ 513 patients attended in January

✅ Average wait time: 

✅ Admission Status: 

✅ Gender Analysis: 

✅ Department Referral: Most patients (299) didn’t require specialist referral, while 103 visited General Practice
🔹 Learned advanced Excel functions
🔹 Worked with Pivot Tables & Charts
🔹 Created interactive filters for better insights
🔹 Improved data storytelling skills

Looking forward to applying these skills in real-world data analysis projects! 🚀
